Problem : Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) in a Binary Tree
You are given a binary tree and two distinct nodes within the tree. Your task is to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of these two nodes. The LCA of two nodes p and q is defined as the lowest node in the tree that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

Input :
* A binary tree represented as a series of nodes where each node has references to its left and right child.
* Two distinct nodes p and q from the tree.
* Input: root = [3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 8, null, null, 7, 4], p = 5, q = 1

Output :
Return the node that is the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of p and q.
Output: 3
